# OceanRuinGenerator

Simulate the generation of Ocean Ruins

Notice: Every room is initially generated as brick, then replaced by cracked, 
and then mossy variation

Thus our generateLoot will return 3 chests for one single room, 
ususally the last one accords with in-game chest, 
for other cases you should check mannually.

(the generator is verified in 1.16.1, I guess also valid for 1.13.2--1.17.1)

Thanks for help: Xinyuuu7, Neil

If you want to run this you also need seedfinding libraries
